# Experiment - 11

**Aim:** Analyse the waveforms of a single phase half bridge inverter using Simulink.
  
**Software Required:** Matlab Simulink 

**Components:** Voltage source, MOSFET, voltage measurement block, scope, display, pulse generator.    

**Theory:**  Single Phase Half Bridge Inverter is a type of Single-Phase Bridge Inverter. It is a voltage source inverter. Voltage source inverter means that the input power of the inverter is a DC voltage Source. Basically, there are two different type of bridge inverters: Single Phase Half Bridge Inverter and Single-Phase Full Bridge Inverter.  

As the input power source is DC, there is no meaning of single phase with respect to input power. However, it does have a meaning with reference to output. The output of singlephase bridge inverter is a single-phase output.
