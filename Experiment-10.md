# Experiment - 10

**Aim:** Analyse the waveforms of a single phase semi converter using Simulink.  
  
**Software Required:** Matlab Simulink 

**Components:** AC Voltage source, Thyristor, voltage measurement block, scope.      

**Theory:**  Single Phase Semi Converter is also known as a half-controlled converter. A single-phase half controlled or semi converter utilizes SCRs(thyristor) and diodes to convert AC power to DC power. Due to the utilization of diodes and thyristors, it provides limited control over the level of DC output voltages.
